Nanoise - Nano Noise

Nanoise is my implementation of the algorithm used by
Toby Schachman on these videos:
http://tobyschachman.com/Shadershop/.

I contacted him, but he don't remember where he saw that algo.
He think it is from the shader comunity. Therefore, this code
bare no licence.

This algorithm is very different from Perlin Noise.

If you want to intuitively understand how this algorithm works,
watch the videos on that page and follow the source.

I just finished the implementation, so there's a lot of room
for improvements and optimizations.

To run the program, type `chmod +x nanoise.c` and run
`nanoise.c`. Yes, run the source!

It depends on imagemagick to convert from pgm to png.
But ffmpeg also do the trick. And many other tools.
